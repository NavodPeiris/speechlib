# Recall.ai - Meeting Transcription API
If you’re looking for a transcription API for meetings, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=speechlib), an API that works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and more. 
Recall.ai diarizes by pulling the speaker data and separate audio streams from the meeting platforms, which means 100% accurate speaker diarization with actual speaker names.

### Run your IDE as administrator

you will get following error if administrator permission is not there:

**OSError: [WinError 1314] A required privilege is not held by the client**

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or greater

### GPU execution

GPU execution needs CUDA 11.  

GPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:

* [cuBLAS for CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
* [cuDNN 8 for CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

There are multiple ways to install these libraries. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below.

### Google Colab:

on google colab run this to install CUDA dependencies:
```
!apt install libcublas11
```

You can see this example [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lpoWrHl5443LSnTG3vJQfTcg9oFiCQSz?usp=sharing)

### installation:
```
pip install speechlib
```

This library does speaker diarization, speaker recognition, and transcription on a single wav file to provide a transcript with actual speaker names. This library will also return an array containing result information. ⚙ 

This library contains following audio preprocessing functions:

1. convert other audio formats to wav

2. convert stereo wav file to mono

3. re-encode the wav file to have 16-bit PCM encoding

Transcriptor method takes 7 arguments. 

1. file to transcribe

2. log_folder to store transcription

3. language used for transcribing (language code is used)

4. model size ("tiny", "small", "medium", "large", "large-v1", "large-v2", "large-v3")

5. ACCESS_TOKEN: huggingface acccess token
    1. Permission to access `pyannote/speaker-diarization@2.1` and `pyannote/segmentation`
    2. Token requires permission for 'Read access to contents of all public gated repos you can access'

6. voices_folder (contains speaker voice samples for speaker recognition)

7. quantization: this determine whether to use int8 quantization or not. Quantization may speed up the process but lower the accuracy.

voices_folder should contain subfolders named with speaker names. Each subfolder belongs to a speaker and it can contain many voice samples. This will be used for speaker recognition to identify the speaker.

if voices_folder is not provided then speaker tags will be arbitrary.

log_folder is to store the final transcript as a text file.

transcript will also indicate the timeframe in seconds where each speaker speaks.

### Transcription example:

```
import os
from speechlib import Transcriptor

file = "obama_zach.wav"  # your audio file
voices_folder = "" # voices folder containing voice samples for recognition
language = "en"          # language code
log_folder = "logs"      # log folder for storing transcripts
modelSize = "tiny"     # size of model to be used [tiny, small, medium, large-v1, large-v2, large-v3]
quantization = False   # setting this 'True' may speed up the process but lower the accuracy
ACCESS_TOKEN = "huggingface api key" # get permission to access pyannote/speaker-diarization@2.1 on huggingface

# quantization only works on faster-whisper
transcriptor = Transcriptor(file, log_folder, language, modelSize, ACCESS_TOKEN, voices_folder, quantization)

# use normal whisper
res = transcriptor.whisper()

# use faster-whisper (simply faster)
res = transcriptor.faster_whisper()

# use a custom trained whisper model
res = transcriptor.custom_whisper("D:/whisper_tiny_model/tiny.pt")

# use a huggingface whisper model
res = transcriptor.huggingface_model("Jingmiao/whisper-small-chinese_base")

# use assembly ai model
res = transcriptor.assemby_ai_model("assemblyAI api key")

res --> [["start", "end", "text", "speaker"], ["start", "end", "text", "speaker"]...]
```

#### if you don't want speaker names: keep voices_folder as an empty string ""

start: starting time of speech in seconds  
end: ending time of speech in seconds  
text: transcribed text for speech during start and end  
speaker: speaker of the text 

#### voices_folder structure:

### Audio preprocessing example:

```
from speechlib import PreProcessor

file = "obama1.mp3"
#initialize
prep = PreProcessor()
# convert mp3 to wav
wav_file = prep.convert_to_wav(file)   

# convert wav file from stereo to mono
prep.convert_to_mono(wav_file)

# re-encode wav file to have 16-bit PCM encoding
prep.re_encode(wav_file)
```

### Performance
```
These metrics are from Google Colab tests.
These metrics do not take into account model download times.
These metrics are done without quantization enabled.
(quantization will make this even faster)
